## Description

This project is a task management application designed to help users organize their day-to-day activities. It allows users to create, edit, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks. Additionally, it provides user authentication functionalities, including registration, login, and email verification.

This is a learning project for the Front End Web Developer bootcamp in IronHack.

## Development Diary

In this section, I share my daily progress on the project, including the features I implemented, the challenges encountered, and how I solved them.

### Day 1: [07-05-2024]

**Progress:**

- _Initial setup & Supabase integration_: We kickstarted by creating the applicationâ€™s skeleton using Vue.js and Vite, and set up our connection to Supabase for user authentication. The setup included user registration and sign-in functionalities, essential for access control based on authentication.

- _Project organization_: The first day was also dedicated to structuring and organizing the project both visually and internally. This involved setting up the project directory, defining the folder structure, and planning out the Vue.js components. Given that this is my first solo project of this kind, establishing a clear and scalable structure from the get-go was imperative.

**Challenges encountered:**

- _Vue.js and Supabase integration difficulties_: Making Vue.js and Supabase work together smoothly took a lot of digging into technical docs and examples. I especially focused on adjusting the authentication process to make sure users have the best experience possible.

- _Lack of design assistance_: Not having access to a dedicated design team presented a unique challenge. It required me to seek inspiration from similar applications and explore UX/UI design examples extensively to craft a coherent and user-friendly interface.

**Solutions:**

- _Self-reliance for UX/UI Inspiration_: Compensated for the absence of a design team by independently researching design trends, analyzing competitive applications, and gathering UX/UI insights. This proactive approach facilitated the conceptualization of a visually appealing and intuitive interface.

### Day 2: [08-05-2024]

**Progress:**

- _Authentication components_: Developed two main components, SignIn and SignUp, to handle the user interface for registration and sign-in, respectively. Also set up a basic mechanism to switch between these components, offering users ease of navigation between sign-in and registration.

- _State management with Pinia_: Used Pinia for managing the application's state in Vue.js, creating stores to handle user data. This approach helped to maintain a clear separation between business logic and user interface, leading to a more robust application architecture.

**Challenges encountered:**

- _Registration and Sign-in Functionality_: Setting up the registration and sign-in features came with its own challenges. Even though I followed the documentation and examples, I hit several roadblocks, especially with getting these functions to work properly.

**Solutions:**

- The breakthrough came after a lot of trial and error, digging deep into JavaScript and Supabase documentation, and getting insights from friends, instructors, and AI. This process showed us the importance of persistence, the value of learning together, and how useful accessible documentation and community support can be.

**In-Progress Efforts:**

- _Notification Mechanism_: Started working on a way to send users a heads-up after they register, reminding them to verify their email. Even though putting a lot of effort into it, we're still figuring out how to get the notification system up and running smoothly. We're still at it, exploring different strategies and solutions to make sure users get the message without a hitch and have a great registration experience.
